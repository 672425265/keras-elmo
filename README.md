# Elmo Embeddings with Tensorflow Hub
This notebook presents a brief demonstration on how to integrate Elmo Embeddings from tensorflow hub into a custom Keras layer that can be directly integrated into a Keras or tensorflow model.

A similar process can be utilized for additional [tf-hub models](https://tfhub.dev/) for easy integration of state of the art pre-trained models into your custom workflows.
